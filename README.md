# sorting-exploration
 Playing around with different sorting algorithms

# Steps
- code sorts
- create testing harness
- visualize performance

# Visualize Performance
## Need to have
- graph of each sort
    - time to finish
    - which sorting algo
- run multiple times w multiple different array size

## Nice to have
- other stats
    - number of comparisons
- other types of data
    - k-sorted
    - reverse sorted
    - n elements unsorted
