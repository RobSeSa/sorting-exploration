# sorting-exploration
Playing around with different sorting algorithms

# Results:
- default Python sort (Tim sort) is awesome !

![Plots](sort_plots.pdf)

# Steps
- code sorts
- create testing harness
- visualize performance

# jupyter notebook
- run each sort on the same input array
- time how long each sort took to complete
- specify length of array, number of repetitions
- save the times it took to sort array
- graph of each sort
    - time to finish
    - which sorting algo
- run multiple times w multiple different array size


# Testing harness
## Need to have
- argparse that specifies which sorts to run
- run each sort on the same input array
- time how long each sort took to complete

## Nice to have
- argparse to specify length of array, number of repetitions

# Visualize Performance
## Need to have
- save the times it took to sort array
- graph of each sort
    - time to finish
    - which sorting algo
- run multiple times w multiple different array size

## Nice to have
- other stats
    - number of comparisons
- other types of data
    - k-sorted
    - reverse sorted
    - n elements unsorted
